# Analyzing Spotify data in all the ways it occurs to me 

In this repository you can find all the different analysis I have been running on spotify data. 
So far I have:
- Playing arround: this is where I try out things without a serious purpose. 
- Am I Basic?: A study of my listening trends. 
- Artist Development: analyzing the properties of the albums of different artists.
- Pride Playlists: Exploring the properties of the playlists Spotify has created for Pride Month. 



## Am I Basic?: 
I am.

I listen more to more popular songs and artists. It is not a perfect correlation, but it is there. 


## Pride Playlists: 
On the morning of June 7th 2022 I was looking at the home page of my spotify app, trying to decide on a series of jams to motivate me to work, when I was suggested this:

I was 50% annoyed at the fact that Spotify is also jumping on the commercialization of pride train, 50% intrigued at what properties must a song have to make it to one of these playlists, and what differences there are between them. 

Here is what I found... (In progress)
